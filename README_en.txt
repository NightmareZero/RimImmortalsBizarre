[h2] summary [/h2]

RimImmortal-Core - RimImmortal-Bizarre Expansion is a mod based on "dao of the bizarre immortal" that adds new content including several new sects and some new spells. 

The mod is still in development and feedback and suggestions are welcome.

In the future, this mod will contain 4 Dharma Trees, namely "AoJing", "Zhengde Temple", "Zuowang Dao", and "White Lotus "

[h2] Introduction to Factions [/h2]

[h3] AoJing [/h3]

The AoJing is a faction that specializes in the manipulation of flesh and blood, and most of their spells are used to gain great power at the expense of their own flesh and blood.
At the same time, they also specialize in healing spells for repairing their wounds.

[b] Typical skills [/b]

[u] fingerprint [/u]: Sacrifice a finger to inflict fan-shaped acid damage, and the flesh and blood will act as a maggot attached to the bone, inflicting intense pain on the enemy.

[u] hand [/u]: Sacrifice a hand to deal high damage to a small area

[u] fire therapy [/u]: Uses flames to cauterize flesh, stopping the bleeding of wounds and also healing some of them at the same time.

[u] regeneration  [/u]: Sacrifice a portion of your internal organs to repair the target's missing parts.

[u] Ascend [/u]: The more pain you feel inside and in your body, the higher your success rate, and the more damage you can do to your internal organs.

[h3] Zuowang Dao [/h3]

Zuowang Dao is a faction that specializes in deception, with most of their spells focusing on tricking the senses of their opponents, and using this to gain access to a resource known as "FeiGang", which can be used to unleash more powerful spells.

[u] graceful words [/u]: Subtle compliments that make the heart grow fonder, success will generate a small amount of FeiGang.

[u] counterfeit trade [/u]: Consume a small amount of FeiGang and transform into the target's coveted treasure, which the target will use their own items in exchange for

[u] scapegoat [/u]: Consume a small amount of FeiGang to transfer negative effects from one person to another

[u] reflection in a mirror  [/u]: Consume a large amount of CongenitalQi to take the target's shadow from the mirror of illusion and reality, 
        because the mirror only reflects half, the target will be incomplete, and will produce a large amount of FeiGang.

[h3] Zhengde Temple [/h3]

When it comes to the Zhengde Temple, its depiction in the book is relatively limited, mainly focusing on the cultivation of flesh and blood and compassion for the common people (of course, there are also some rather RJW-related parts, but I do not intend to touch on those aspects).

Thus, when designing Zhengde Temple, I thought about whether, when the "Great Nuo" world returns to a normal state at the end of the book, it would have a normal cultivation method. However, there were too many related ideas, so I simply set Zhengde Temple to start with only a few abilities, which gradually strengthen and unlock new abilities through skill usage and self-cultivation.

[b] Initial Skills [/b]

[u] Meditation [/u]: In walking, sitting, and lying down, comprehend Zen principles, reduce movement speed, but cultivation progress will increase over time. Other special abilities will gradually unlock with cultivation.

[u] Zen Sound [/u]: Emit a sound containing Zen meaning, awakening people. Relieves confusion and berserk states, while slightly increasing consciousness and manipulation. This will bring you closer to the "Enlightenment" path.

[u] Almsgiving [/u]: Cut flesh to feed the eagle. Replenishes the target's hunger and rest, while enhancing the target's healing speed. This will bring you closer to the "Self-Sacrifice" path.

[u] Breakthrough [/u]: Choose an available path for breakthrough.(With each successful breakthrough, a new bionic organism will be obtained, with a maximum of 8 bionic organisms per route)

[b] Cultivation Paths [/b]

[u] Self-Restraint [/u]: The method of self-restraint, not seeking the magical powers of the Dharma, focusing on cultivating oneself. As cultivation progresses, your work efficiency and research speed will improve.

[u] Enlightenment [/u]: To explain Buddhist principles to all beings and save them, lacking offensive capabilities, focusing on control and protection.

[u] Self-Sacrifice [/u]: Sacrificing oneself to solve difficulties for all beings. However, be careful, this is not 'Great Nuo', and the one responding to you may not necessarily be 'Siming'.

[h3] Bingjia [/h3]

This is a recent idea that emerged temporarily, it should be a small-scale sect with fewer skills. It is a relatively cheap frontline, relying on weapons imbued with evil energy to inherit cultivation.

[h3] White Lotus [/h3]
