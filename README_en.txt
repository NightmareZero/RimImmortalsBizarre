[h2] Introduction to Factions [/h2]

[h3] AoJing [/h3]

The AoJing is a faction that specializes in the manipulation of flesh and blood, and most of their spells are used to gain great power at the expense of their own flesh and blood.
At the same time, they also specialize in healing spells for repairing their wounds.
