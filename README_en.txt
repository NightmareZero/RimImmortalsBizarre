[h2] Introduction to Factions [/h2]

[h3] AoJing [/h3]

The AoJing is a faction that specializes in the manipulation of flesh and blood, and most of their spells are used to gain great power at the expense of their own flesh and blood.
At the same time, they also specialize in healing spells for repairing their wounds.

[b] Typical skills [/b]

[u] fingerprint [/u]: Sacrifice a finger to inflict fan-shaped acid damage, and the flesh and blood will act as a maggot attached to the bone, inflicting intense pain on the enemy.

[u] hand [/u]: Sacrifice a hand to deal high damage to a small area

[u] fire therapy [/u]: Uses flames to cauterize flesh, stopping the bleeding of wounds and also healing some of them at the same time.

[u] regeneration  [/u]: Sacrifice a portion of your internal organs to repair the target's missing parts.

[u] Ascend [/u]: The more pain you feel inside and in your body, the higher your success rate, and the more damage you can do to your internal organs.

[h3] Zuowang Dao [/h3]

testing...
Zuowang Dao is a faction that specializes in deception, with most of their spells focusing on tricking the senses of their opponents, and using this to gain access to a resource known as "FeiGang", which can be used to unleash more powerful spells.

[u] graceful words [/u]: Subtle compliments that make the heart grow fonder, success will generate a small amount of FeiGang.

[u] counterfeit trade [/u]: Consume a small amount of FeiGang and transform into the target's coveted treasure, which the target will use their own items in exchange for

[u] scapegoat [/u]: Consume a small amount of FeiGang to transfer negative effects from one person to another

[u] reflection in a mirror  [/u]: Consume a large amount of CongenitalQi to take the target's shadow from the mirror of illusion and reality, 
        because the mirror only reflects half, the target will be incomplete, and will produce a large amount of FeiGang.
